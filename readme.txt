The only plugin you need for integrating your WordPress site with your CRM.

== Description ==

WP Fusion is a WordPress plugin that connects what happens on your website to your CRM or marketing automation tool. Using WP Fusion you can build a membership site, keep your customersâ€™ information in sync with CRM contact records, capture new leads, record ecommerce transactions, and much more.

= Features =

* Automatically create new contacts in your CRM when new users are added in WordPress
	* Can limit user creation to specified user roles
	* Assign tags to newly-created users
* Restrict access to content based on a user's CRM tags
	* Option to redirect to alternate page if requested page is locked
	* Shortcodes to selectively hide/show content within posts
* Apply tags when a user visits a certain page (with configurable delay)
* Configurable synchronization of user meta fields with contact fields
	* Update a contact record in your CRM when a user's profile is updated
* LearnDash, Sensei, and LifterLMS integrations for managing online courses
* Integration with numerous membership and ecommerce plugins

== Installation ==

Upload and activate the plugin, then go to Settings >> WP Fusion. Select your desired CRM, enter your API credentials and click "Test Connection" to verify the connection and perform the first synchronization. This may take some time if you have many user accounts on your site. See our [Getting Started Guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/#getting-started-guide) for more information on setting up your application.

** Heads up! ** This update includes a significant refactor of WP Fusion's admin settings, interfaces, and database storage. We've tested the update extensively, but with 3,500+ changes across 200+ files, there are potentially bugs we've missed. If that sounds scary, you may want to wait until v3.38.1 is released before updating.

If there are bugs, they will most likely affect saving WP Fusion settings in the admin (general settings, access rules, product configurations, etc.) and not affect the existing access rules or sync configuration on your site.
